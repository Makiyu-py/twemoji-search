### Setting-up

Before all of this, don't forget to fork this repo, clone and `cd` into it!
(and also don't forget install yarn)

#### Installing dependencies

You may do that with a single command!

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

#### Running the web server

##### For Development

You may use the `serve` script that is in the `package.json` file.

```bash
yarn run serve
```

then go to `http://localhost:8080/`!

#### For Production

Build with the `build` script:

```bash
yarn run build
```

(that'll build the source and put them in a folder named `dist`)

then we'll use the [`serve` package](https://github.com/vercel/serve) to run the dist directory locally.

```bash
yarn dlx serve -s dist -l 8080
# you may also download the package
# `yarn global add serve`
# then run: `serve -s dist -l 8080`
```

then once again, go to `http://localhost:8080/`!
